What I should buy:

-1 chicken breast (120,000 VND)
-1 can of tuna (30,000 VND)
-1 bottle of water (10,000 VND)
-1 bag of rice (50,000 VND)

The total cost of these items would be 210,000 VND, which is under the 400,000 VND budget. These items would provide a good source of protein and basic nutrition.
